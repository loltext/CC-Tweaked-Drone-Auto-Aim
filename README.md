# CC:Tweaked Drone Auto-Aim

This is one of my first projects using **CC:Tweaked** and **Kontraption**.

The project implements a very simple **drone auto-aim system** that can also be reused as a basic **autopilot**.  
It’s not perfect, but it works and can be used as a starting point for more advanced automation.


## 🚀 Usage – Very Important
1. When building your drone or ship, make sure the front is facing east when assembling it with VS, otherwise it will not work correctly.  
2. Place the Ship Control Interface next to the PC that has the drone files, or you can also connect it via a wired modem.  
3. Make sure to have a gyroscope connected to a battery and an ion thruster to propel the drone.  
4. When building your drone, I recommend using lightweight materials. I also suggest using the Zero Point Labs mod and equipping your drone with a Mass Suspension Matrix to avoid gravity-related issues.
5. In the Pocket code, make sure that your drone’s PC ID matches so you can send messages via Rednet.
